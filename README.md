# Customer Churn Analysis

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer churn using a dataset containing customer details, usage behavior, and churn labels. The goal is to build machine learning and deep learning models to predict churn and derive actionable insights for business improvement.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of various features related to customer demographics, account information, and service usage. You can download the dataset from the following link:

**[Download Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)**

Key attributes include:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer
- **Tenure**: Number of months the customer has been with the company
- **Monthly Charges**: Monthly service fee paid by the customer
- **Total Charges**: Cumulative charges incurred by the customer
- **Contract Type**: Type of subscription contract (e.g., Monthly, Yearly)
- **Payment Method**: Mode of payment used
- **Churn**: Target variable indicating whether a customer has churned (Yes/No)

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and outliers.
   - Encoded categorical variables.
   - Standardized numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized key insights using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
   - Identified patterns and correlations affecting churn rates.
3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Created new features to improve model performance.
   - Selected relevant features based on correlation analysis.
4. **Model Training**
   - Used different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
   - Implemented deep learning models using TensorFlow/Keras.
   - Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Model Evaluation and Interpretation**
   - Analyzed feature importance.
   - Used SHAP values to interpret model decisions.
   - Compared machine learning and deep learning model performance.

## Results and Insights

- Customers with **monthly contracts** were more likely to churn compared to those with longer-term contracts.
- Higher **monthly charges** correlated with an increased churn rate.
- Customers who used **automatic payment methods** had a lower churn rate.
- The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of **X%** (replace with your model's accuracy).
- Deep learning models provided **X%** improvement (if applicable) over traditional machine learning models.

## Future Improvements

- Collect more data to enhance model performance.
- Implement real-time churn prediction for proactive customer retention strategies.
- Optimize deep learning models for better accuracy and efficiency.

## How to Run the Notebook

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow keras
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
3. Review the model performance and insights.

## Conclusion

This project provides valuable insights into customer churn patterns and predictive modeling techniques using both machine learning and deep learning. The findings can help businesses enhance customer retention strategies and reduce churn rates.
